          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I started learning code after getting into the college and didn't even write a single line before. So, In the process of learning i've come accross DSA in my first year and then eventually started my programming journey and then started participating in contests and all and now I wish I started earlier XD. But as of now I feel happy when I see my rating increasing and parallely I wanted to improve my development skills which I think is also equally important. If you also started a bit late then I'd say It's better to start now than procastinating that you didn't start it earlier which I did XP and proved quite a waste of time.</p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>I've done a few projects.Automatic Ad-blocker and a youtube ad skipper - which is a group project.Automatic Ad-blocker is a project (browser extension) aimed at blocking all the browser ads automatically. Works for all blockable browser ads as well as pop-up banner ads/ cookies.same with yt-ad skipper, aimed at skipping all the skippable youtube ads automatically.. Next one is a small game called Brain-train which I made by using kotlin, Android studio it's a basic mobile game-app. And then a website to keep my to do list for the day and then mark it when i was done. And a personal website. All of them using html,css,js, and few tech like using API's. </p>
